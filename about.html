  <h1>About Strata Nova AS</h1>
  
  <p><strong>We make sense of human experience through data, and make data meaningful for humans.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Strata Nova AS operates at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, machine learning, and data science. We solve methodological problems that arise when analyzing complex human data — bringing rigorous standards to every step of the research process, while embracing not knowing as the first step toward knowing.</p>
  
  <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
  
  <p>Our dual expertise combines rigorous psychological science with computational knowledge, identifying methodological gaps that specialists in either field alone might miss. We don't just analyze data; we translate between human complexity and computational insights.</p>
  
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  
  <p>Consider a simple example: your HR system shows performance scores for employees. Most take these at face value — but how was performance actually measured? What if the error margin is very large? If you're making hiring or promotion decisions based on flawed measurement, you might be letting your best talent go because you trusted the numbers without understanding how they were created.</p>
  
  <p>The same applies to any human data: taking Big Five personality results at face value without understanding the measurement process can be misleading. Even skilled data scientists can build sophisticated models, but if the underlying data collection was flawed, the analysis will inherit those problems. We help bridge this gap by understanding both sides — how human data should be collected and how it should be analyzed.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Dual Purpose</h2>
  
  <p>We operate with two complementary missions:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Specialized Consulting</strong>: Delivering services that combine psychological rigor with computational methods</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative Platform</strong>: Connecting researchers, students, and businesses for meaningful partnerships</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>How We Work</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Evidence-Based Practice</strong>: We integrate rigorous research evidence with domain expertise, tailored to your specific organizational context. Rather than following generic "best practices," we ground business decisions in solid research while ensuring they remain practical and contextually appropriate.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Open Science Approach</strong>: We document what works and what doesn't, what we know for certain and what remains uncertain. This transparency creates better learning opportunities and more trustworthy results.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Collaborative by Design</strong>: Rather than waiting for the perfect business plan, we've chosen to start now and evolve through meaningful work and partnerships.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  
  <p>We're building an evidence-based practice for business — where methodological integrity meets practical application. Whether you're a student seeking experience, a researcher wanting to apply work beyond academia, or a business needing rigorous approaches to human-centered problems, we're actively seeking collaborators.</p>
  
  <p>We're here to help navigate that complexity with clarity and rigor. Please feel free to reach out with questions, for collaboration, or if you have a potential project for us.</p>
